  big idea: we can abstract away the complex connection between physics and electronics, and then
    abstract away those abstractions to even simpler abstractions.
  overview:
  details:
    - engineering is the purposeful use of science
    - we use abstractions (i.e., natural laws, equations such as Maxwell's, etc) as
      simplifications that we can use like legos to build things

    - we build abstractions in the following order, using each abstraction as a building block
      that simplifies the complex underpinnings
      - base layer: nature and the study of it, notably physics
      - lump circuit abstraction: we assume certain simplifications that allow us to lump
        together complex systems of things into a single thing (i.e., discrete things).
          - resistors: an abstract notion of whatever it is we're trying to get current to (e.g.)
          - voltage
          - current
      - amplifier abstraction: when we get to amplifiers, we abstract away from maxwell's equations
      - digital abstraction: logic gates, inverters
      - combination logic abstraction: includes functional blocks
      - clock abstraction: notion of time introduced
      - instruction set abstraction: x86, e.g., and others: consumer-level
      - language abstractions: c, java, and so on
      - software system abstractions: operating systems, such as linux

      - the above deals with the digital abstractions path, but there is also the analog path (it
        splits off at the digital break above)
        - op-amp abstraction: the operational amplifier
        - analog system components: oscillators, power supplies, and so on
        - the op-amp and analog system components combine to build system controllers, toasters,
          and so on

    - abstraction from maxwell's equations to simplified algebreic expressions
      - imagine a light bulb hooked up to a battery with wires
      - what is the current to the bulb?
        - we could use maxwell's equations and figure out how to get the current, but that's
          quite complicated
        - the easy way is to abstract away the bulb, let it be resistor R, and then it seems
          to be intuitive enough that the current = voltage / resistance from R
          - how do we get to this simplifications?
            - the lumped matter discipline: the real equation looks more complicated, and it isn't
              well explained in the video
