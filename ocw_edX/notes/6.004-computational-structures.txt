Logarithms: logarithms undo exponentiation. If we have 2^x = 16, log_2 16 = x is an equivalent
  statement. In English: what do I have to raise 2 to to get 16?

  Another example: log_3 81 = x, which is to say what x do we have to raise 3 to to get 81?
    3^4 = 81, so log_3 81 = 4.

 Claude Shannon's definition of information received:
   with N possible values, x_1, x_2, x_3 ... x_N, and
   associated probabilities, P_1, P_2, P_3, ... .

   Information(x_i) = log_2 (1/P_i)

   That is, the information of that particular possibility is the log (base 2 since
   we store information in bits) of the inverse probability of that particualr possibility, which
   is the uncertainty that that possibility obtains.

   Said better: more information is had when more uncertainty is resolved
