OAuth2 gained wide acceptance, but the following challenges emerged:

  - Anti-patterns and implementation weaknesses are vectors of attack for OAuth2.
    See RFC6819 for more details.
  - Technology has changed such that the implicit grant's security model has changed.
  - OAuth2 is used in environments with stricter security requirements (eGovernment,
    eBanking, etc.) calling for additional guidelines.
  - OAuth2 is used in dynamic setups (whatever that means), posing new challenges to security
    that the original RFC's scope didn't consider.

Expands attacker model, laying out what MUST prevented attacker-wise to be OAuth2

- auth servers MUST utilize exact matching of client redirect URIs against pre-registered URIs.
- clients SHOULD avoid forwarding the user's browser to a URI obtained from a query param to prevent exfiltration of auth codes and access tokens
- clients MUST prevent cross-site request-forgery (CSRF)
- something about mix-up attacks and using the same auth server
- clients using auth grant type MUST use PKCE in order to detect and prevent attempts to inject (replay) auth codes into auth response
- Clients SHOULD use PKCE code challenge methods that don't expose PKCE verifiy in auth request
- auth server must support PKCE (RFC7636)
- auth servers SHOULD provide a way to detect their support for PKCE


- no access_tokens in query params: they get into browser history, and can be used if the device is compromised

- mix-up auth attack is an attacker intercepting a request, changing the auth endpoint to the attacker's. (There are some preconditions that must be met.)
  - return client_id and authorization server identifier for which a code or token was issued in the auth response. This lets clients compare that data to its own records.

- use 302 status code to redirect, not 307: 307 can replay original POST content

- to prevent phishing, we could return a `access_token_resource_server key in the response body with the URL(s) an access token is good for. This puts the security concern on the client, which isn't a terrible idea. 4.8.1.1.
